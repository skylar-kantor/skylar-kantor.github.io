<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>Despite having been programming in one form or another for quite some time, until the summer of 2022, I had absolutely zero desire to touch web development.
But during the summer, I interned with M&T Bank and and was assigned to a team where I was asked to do some web development work, and realized that I had been missing out on a very interesting part of the tech world.
As it turns out, web design and development can be really rewarding, and so I'm building this site both as a portfolio and to try and keep up the skills I started learning at my internship. Hopefully, in addition to the technical end of things,
having to design this site from the ground up will help me to build a good foundation in design as well.</p>

<h2>Me</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Skylar! I use they/them pronouns (or she/her or ey/em, any of the 3 is perfectly okay).</p>
 
<h2>My Projects</h2>

<p>I'll be listing all of my school projects (that I'm allowed to share publically, UB academic integrity policies prevent me from sharing all of my code), under <a href = "school.html">the School Projects page</a>.
I also have a few projects I work on in my free time, and although not all of them are programming related, I'll be sharing those here as well.</p>
