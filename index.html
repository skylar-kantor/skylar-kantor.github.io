<h2>This Site</h2>
Despite having been programming in one form or another for quite some time, until the summer of 2022, I had absolutely zero desire to touch web development.
But during the summer, I interned with M&T Bank and and was assigned to a team where I was asked to do some web development work, and realized that I had been missing out on a very interesting part of the tech world.
As it turns out, web design and development can be really rewarding, and so I'm building this site both as a portfolio and to try and keep up the skills I started learning at my internship. Hopefully, in addition to the technical end of things,
having to design this site from the ground up will help me to build a good foundation in design as well.
