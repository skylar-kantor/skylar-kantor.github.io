<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>Despite having been programming in one form or another for quite some time, until the summer of 2022, I had absolutely zero desire to touch web development.
But during the summer, I interned with M&T Bank and and was assigned to a team where I was asked to do some web development work, and realized that I had been missing out on a very interesting part of the tech world.
As it turns out, web design and development can be really rewarding, and so I'm building this site both as a portfolio and to try and keep up the skills I started learning at my internship. Hopefully, in addition to the technical end of things,
having to design this site from the ground up will help me to build a good foundation in design as well.</p>

<h2>Me</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Skylar! I use they/them pronouns (or she/her or ey/em, any of the 3 is perfectly okay). I'm a computer science student at the University at Buffalo, graduating in May of 2023. While I'm not in class, I spend a bunch of time either helping to run the UB chapter of Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, or working with Ball Aerospace COSMOS for the University At Buffalo Nanosatellite Lab's GLADOS mission.
For more, see the About page. </p>
 
<h2>My Projects</h2>

<p>I'll be listing all of my school projects (that I'm allowed to share publically, UB academic integrity policies prevent me from sharing all of my code), under the School Projects page.
I also have a few projects I work on in my free time, and although not all of them are programming related, I'll be sharing those here as well.</p>
