    <p>I was given a somewhat broken WP-500 word processor about a year ago. As a part of trying to learn more about embedded system
  programming, as well as some hardware skills, I'm working on using a Raspberry Pi and Nucleo development board to run the typewriter portion and the CRT.</p></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/skylar-kantor/cinnamon-bt-proxlock"><h3>Bluetooth Auto-lock</h3></a><p>During the Fall of 2020, I was attending online classes while living on campus at UB. Because I was in a dorm room, with a roommate, I wanted to make sure
  that I wouldn't have to worry about my roommate potentially seeing what I had been working on in my class projects, as we had some classes together at the time. To deal with this, I wrote a python script that would automatically lock my laptop when my phone was no longer connected to it via Bluetooth. While writing this script, I learned that my phone also uses the laptop audio as an output for music while it's connected, so I added media controls, allowing me to pause music or skip songs playing on my phone while I'm working, without having to check my phone and potentially being distracted.</p></li>
